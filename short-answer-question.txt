In the simplest terms, the Express code is mainly concerned with
behind-the-scenes, server-side goings-on, while the Vue parts handle rendering
the frontend and giving the user something nice to look at and interact with.

The Express code, for example, will determine what to tell the browser to
render when a certain URL is entered, or routing. It also handles the data
needed and produced by the web app and governs its interactions with the
database, mediating the relationship between the Vue app and the database it
needs through an API.

The Vue code, on the other hand, is more important to the end-user, as it
governs the way the app is rendered in the user's browser. Input validation is
performed within the Vue code, as well as delineating the styles for each
page. The Vue code loops all the frontend elements in together to make their
relationship with the backend more modular and straightforward, since it
rewards the developer who breaks up their code into components with a modular
system with easily interchangeable parts and easier debugging.
